# The number of marriage licenses issued in the Greater Toronto Area since 2011

## Overview of Paper

This report aims to investigate the total number of marriage licenses issued each year in the Greater Toronto Area from 2011 to 2023 and the total number of marriage licenses issued by different civic centers during this period to find if the report about declining marriages is true. I found that the number of marriage licenses issued of recent years in the GTA has remained stable except for 2020 and 2021, the two years most affected by the outbreak of the pandemic.
